# Overview
This to-do app harnesses the robust capabilities of React, a powerful web framework, to help you manage and track your tasks efficiently. With its persistent task tracking feature, this application ensures that your to-dos are saved and easily accessible, providing a reliable and user-friendly experience for managing your daily tasks.

# Learnings
In this project, I ventured beyond my comfort zone by exploring React, a popular JavaScript library for building user interfaces. My journey with React was enlightening and challenging, as it pushed me to adapt to a new framework and its idiosyncrasies.

One of the key learning experiences was dealing with React's Strict Mode, a tool for highlighting potential problems in an application. Initially, this led to some issues, but it ultimately proved invaluable in helping me achieve the vision I had for this project. The strict mode served as a guiding force, ensuring that my code adhered to best practices and was robust.

The final outcome is a to-do list application that not only meets my initial expectations but also reflects the rich learning experience I gained through this project. This application is a testament to the growth and knowledge I've acquired in React, and I'm excited to apply these skills in future projects.

# Usage
## Getting Started with Create React App

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).

## Available Scripts

In the project directory, you can run:

### `npm start`

Runs the app in the development mode.\
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in your browser.

The page will reload when you make changes.\
You may also see any lint errors in the console.

### `npm test`

Launches the test runner in the interactive watch mode.\
See the section about [running tests](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/running-tests) for more information.

### `npm run build`

Builds the app for production to the `build` folder.\
It correctly bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance.

The build is minified and the filenames include the hashes.\
Your app is ready to be deployed!

See the section about [deployment](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/deployment) for more information.

### `npm run eject`

**Note: this is a one-way operation. Once you `eject`, you can't go back!**

If you aren't satisfied with the build tool and configuration choices, you can `eject` at any time. This command will remove the single build dependency from your project.

Instead, it will copy all the configuration files and the transitive dependencies (webpack, Babel, ESLint, etc) right into your project so you have full control over them. All of the commands except `eject` will still work, but they will point to the copied scripts so you can tweak them. At this point you're on your own.

You don't have to ever use `eject`. The curated feature set is suitable for small and middle deployments, and you shouldn't feel obligated to use this feature. However we understand that this tool wouldn't be useful if you couldn't customize it when you are ready for it.
